# Architecture Decision Record: Database Migrations with Alembic

## Context

The Pulse AI project requires a database schema that will evolve as the project develops. We need a system to track and apply database changes in a controlled, versioned manner across development and production environments.

## Decision

We have implemented Alembic as our database migration system for the following reasons:

1. **SQLAlchemy Integration**: Alembic is designed to work with SQLAlchemy, which we already use for our ORM.
2. **Version Control**: Alembic provides a clear versioning system for database schema changes.
3. **Bidirectional Migrations**: Support for both upgrading and downgrading the database schema.
4. **Flexibility**: Alembic allows both autogenerated migrations and hand-crafted migrations for complex scenarios.
5. **Community Support**: Alembic is a mature, well-documented tool with strong community support.

## Implementation Details

### Directory Structure

```
pulse-ai/
├── alembic.ini          # Configuration file
├── migrations/          # Migration scripts directory
│   ├── README           # Migration documentation
│   ├── env.py           # Migration environment setup
│   ├── script.py.mako   # Script template
│   └── versions/        # Individual migration scripts
```

### Configuration

The Alembic configuration is set up to:

1. Connect to our SQLite database during development (configurable for PostgreSQL in production)
2. Automatically detect schema changes from our SQLAlchemy models
3. Generate migration scripts in the `migrations/versions/` directory
4. Handle circular dependencies in our data model by creating tables in the correct order

### Migration Workflow

1. Developers make changes to SQLAlchemy models
2. Run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"` to generate migration
3. Review and potentially edit the generated migration script
4. Apply with `alembic upgrade head`
5. Commit both model changes and migration script to version control

### Handling Circular Dependencies

Our data model includes several circular dependencies (e.g., Department → Employee → Department). We resolved this by:

1. Creating tables in a specific order that avoids circular references
2. Adding circular foreign keys after the referenced tables exist
3. Using SQLAlchemy's `backref` and `remote_side` features to handle the relationships properly

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Django Migrations**: Not chosen as we're using SQLAlchemy instead of Django ORM.
2. **Raw SQL Scripts**: Less maintainable and lacks automatic versioning.
3. **SQLAlchemy-Migrate**: Older and less actively maintained than Alembic.
4. **Flyway/Liquibase**: More oriented towards Java environments.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Schema changes are tracked in version control
- Multiple developers can make schema changes without conflicts
- Production deployments can be tested on staging environments
- Ability to roll back problematic schema changes
- Clear documentation of database evolution

### Negative

- Additional learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Alembic
- Some complex migrations may require manual intervention
- Need to ensure migrations are tested thoroughly before deployment

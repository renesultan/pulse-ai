# Pulse AI: Organizational Visualization Design Specification

## 1. Overview

This document defines the design specification for Pulse AI's interactive organizational visualization component. The visualization will provide users with a comprehensive view of the company structure, objectives, progress tracking, and dependencies.

## 2. Core Visualization Approach

### 2.1 Fundamental Structure

The visualization will implement a **hierarchical layout with relationship overlays** that combines:

- **Base Hierarchical Structure**: A clean, intuitive organizational tree visualization that represents reporting lines and organizational hierarchy
- **Relationship Overlays**: Interactive elements to visualize cross-functional relationships, shared objectives, and dependencies
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information density increases as users dig deeper into specific areas of interest

### 2.2 Design Principles

1. **Clarity Over Density**: Maintain a clean visual design that prioritizes understanding over information quantity
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Begin with high-level information, revealing detail as users interact with elements
3. **Focus + Context**: When focusing on specific elements, maintain visibility of surrounding context (faded but present)
4. **Visual Consistency**: Use consistent visual language for node types, relationships, and status indicators

## 3. User Interaction Model

### 3.1 Node Interaction

The system will implement a dual-mode interaction pattern to handle both expansion and information viewing:

- **Click on Node Center/Body**: Expands or collapses the node to show or hide sub-components
- **Click on Info Icon/Button**: Opens the side panel with detailed information about the node
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear affordances showing which nodes can be expanded further

### 3.2 Information Display

Detailed information will be displayed in a **side panel** that:

- Slides in from the right edge of the screen with an elegant animation
- Maintains the graph position and context unchanged in the main view
- Separates the concerns of structure (graph) and details (panel)
- Adapts to various node types with appropriate information organization

### 3.3 Navigation 

- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Shows current context and hierarchy path
- **Focus Controls**: Allow zooming into specific branches while maintaining overall context
- **Expand/Collapse**: Interactive controls at both individual and branch levels
- **Search**: Quick access to specific nodes, objectives, or metrics

## 4. Information Architecture

### 4.1 Side Panel Content Structure

#### Header Section
- Node name and type (e.g., "Engineering Department")
- Reporting relationship ("Reports to: CTO")
- Quick stats (headcount, budget, overall health)

#### Progress Section
- Objectives owned with progress bars
- Color-coded status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Key metrics/KPIs specific to that entity

#### Context Section
- List of sub-components with mini-status indicators
- Dependencies on other nodes
- Teams/projects this node is responsible for

#### Issues Section
- Highlighted red flags or blockers
- Recent status updates
- Critical dependencies affecting progress

#### Third-Party Integration Section
- Clean, icon-based links to relevant external tools (Jira, Notion, etc.)
- Minimal status indicators (small colored dots or subtle badges)
- Tool information shown only on hover to maintain cleanliness
- Context-aware deep links to specific team workspaces

### 4.2 Node Types and Visual Representation

Each node type will have distinct visual characteristics:

- **Executive/C-Suite**: Highest level nodes with company-wide objectives
- **Departments**: Major organizational divisions with specialized functions
- **Sub-departments/Teams**: Functional units within departments
- **Individuals**: Team members with specific roles and responsibilities (optional, deepest level)

### 4.3 Status and Progress Visualization

- **Color Coding**: Red (at risk), Yellow (requires attention), Green (on track)
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear visual representation of completion percentage
- **Dependency Lines**: Connecting lines showing relationships between nodes
- **Status Icons**: Consistent iconography for quick pattern recognition

## 5. Technical Implementation

### 5.1 Recommended Visualization Technology

React Flow is recommended as the primary visualization library due to:
- Its focus on interactive node-based UIs
- Support for custom node types and relationships
- Excellent performance characteristics for organizational chart-style visualizations
- Good integration with React ecosystem

Alternative technologies for consideration:
- D3.js for fully custom visualizations (more development effort)
- Sigma.js for larger network graphs
- Cytoscape.js for more complex graph theory applications

### 5.2 Data Structure

#### Node Data Model
```json
{
  "id": "eng-dept",
  "type": "department",
  "name": "Engineering Department",
  "parentId": "company",
  "children": ["frontend-eng", "backend-eng", "devops-eng"],
  "objectives": ["obj-123", "obj-456"],
  "reportingManager": "cto",
  "metadata": {
    "headcount": 161,
    "budget": 7500000,
    "location": "Austin, TX"
  },
  "externalTools": [
    {
      "type": "jira",
      "url": "https://company.atlassian.net/browse/ENG",
      "statusIndicator": "warning",
      "requiresAuth": true
    },
    {
      "type": "notion",
      "url": "https://notion.so/company/engineering-392a8b",
      "statusIndicator": "normal" 
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Objective Data Model
```json
{
  "id": "obj-123",
  "title": "Launch next-gen platform",
  "description": "Deploy the new cloud platform with AI capabilities",
  "status": "at_risk",
  "progress": 67,
  "owners": ["eng-dept", "product-dept"],
  "parentObjective": "company-obj-1",
  "keyResults": [
    {
      "id": "kr-1",
      "description": "Complete 5 key AI features",
      "target": 5,
      "current": 3,
      "unit": "count"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Relationship Model
```json
{
  "id": "rel-789",
  "type": "depends_on",
  "sourceId": "team-a",
  "targetId": "team-b",
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Requires API completion",
    "status": "blocked",
    "priority": "high"
  }
}
```

### 5.3 API Requirements

#### Core Endpoints
1. **GET /api/graph** - Get the entire graph structure (with optional depth parameter)
2. **GET /api/nodes/{nodeId}** - Get detailed information about a specific node
3. **GET /api/nodes/{nodeId}/children** - Get child nodes for a given parent
4. **GET /api/nodes/{nodeId}/objectives** - Get objectives related to a node
5. **GET /api/nodes/{nodeId}/external-tools** - Get external tool links for a node

#### Third-Party Integration
1. **GET /api/integration/{tool}/status** - Get minimal status information from external tool
2. **POST /api/integration/auth-request** - Request access to restricted tools
3. **GET /api/user/tool-permissions** - Check current user's access to various tools

## 6. User Experience Considerations

### 6.1 Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed data only when nodes are expanded or selected
- **Data Caching**: Cache recently viewed nodes and their details
- **Partial Rendering**: Only render visible or nearby nodes with appropriate detail level
- **Throttled Updates**: Limit refresh rate for real-time updates to prevent performance issues

### 6.2 Accessibility

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and roles for graph components
- **Color Considerations**: Status colors should be distinguishable even with color vision deficiency
- **Text Scaling**: Support for browser text scaling without breaking the interface

### 6.3 Responsive Design

- **Adaptive Layout**: Reconfigure visualization based on screen size
- **Touch Support**: Larger hit areas and appropriate interactions for touch devices
- **Panel Behavior**: On smaller screens, panel may use full-width overlay instead of side panel

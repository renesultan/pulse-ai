# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for the Pulse AI project, providing clear guidelines for contributing code that aligns with the project's technical design and quality standards.

## Development Lifecycle

### 1. Feature Planning

1. **Understand Requirements**
   - Review the feature specification in the project roadmap
   - Clarify any ambiguities with the project lead
   - Understand how the feature fits into the overall architecture

2. **Design First Approach**
   - Create a brief design document for significant features
   - Outline the approach, data models, and API changes
   - Get feedback from team members before implementation

### 2. Development Process

1. **Branch Creation**
   - Create a feature branch from `main`
   - Use the naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
   - For bug fixes, use: `fix/issue-description`

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Break down the work into small, logical commits
   - Follow the project's coding standards
   - Write tests alongside code

3. **Commit Guidelines**
   - Use conventional commit messages:
     - `feat: add new visualization component`
     - `fix: resolve issue with data loading`
     - `refactor: improve performance of alignment calculation`
     - `docs: update API documentation`
     - `test: add tests for resource allocation service`
   - Keep commits focused and atomic
   - Include issue numbers when applicable: `feat: add team filter (#123)`

4. **Local Testing**
   - Run unit tests before pushing changes
   - Verify that your changes work as expected
   - Check for any regressions

### 3. Code Review Process

1. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Push your branch to GitHub
   - Create a pull request against `main`
   - Fill out the PR template with details about your changes

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **PR Requirements**
   - Link to related issues
   - Provide a clear description of the changes
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Address any linting issues

3. **Code Review**
   - Respond to reviewer comments promptly
   - Make requested changes in new commits
   - Request re-review when ready
   - Use the PR discussion for technical debates

4. **Approval and Merge**
   - PRs require at least one approval from a core team member
   - Squash and merge into `main`
   - Delete the branch after merging

### 4. Deployment

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated tests run on every PR
   - Code quality checks are performed
   - Build artifacts are generated

2. **Staging Deployment**
   - Merged changes are automatically deployed to staging
   - Perform manual verification on staging
   - Report any issues found

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Production deployments occur on a regular schedule
   - Hotfixes may be deployed immediately after testing
   - Monitor for any issues after deployment

## Technical Guidelines

### Backend Development

1. **API Design**
   - Follow RESTful principles
   - Use plural nouns for resources (e.g., `/api/objectives`)
   - Include versioning in API paths (e.g., `/api/v1/objectives`)
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes

2. **FastAPI Implementation**
   - Use dependency injection for services
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Document API endpoints with docstrings
   - Use Pydantic models for request/response validation

3. **Database Access**
   - Use SQLAlchemy models for database operations
   - Implement repository pattern for data access
   - Write migrations for schema changes
   - Optimize queries for performance

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for services and repositories
   - Create integration tests for API endpoints
   - Use fixtures for test data
   - Mock external dependencies

### Frontend Development

1. **Component Structure**
   - Follow atomic design principles
   - Create reusable components
   - Separate container and presentation components
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for props

2. **State Management**
   - Use React Context for global state
   - Implement React Query for API data
   - Keep component state minimal
   - Use reducers for complex state logic

3. **Styling**
   - Use CSS modules or styled-components
   - Follow the project's design system
   - Ensure responsive design
   - Support dark mode where applicable

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for components
   - Create integration tests for pages
   - Use snapshot testing for UI components
   - Test error states and edge cases

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality

1. **Linting and Formatting**
   - Backend: flake8, black, isort
   - Frontend: ESLint, Prettier
   - Run linters before committing

2. **Code Reviews**
   - Focus on logic, architecture, and performance
   - Check for security issues
   - Verify error handling
   - Ensure proper documentation

3. **Testing Standards**
   - Maintain 80%+ test coverage
   - Test happy paths and edge cases
   - Include performance tests for critical paths
   - Write readable and maintainable tests

### Performance Considerations

1. **Backend Performance**
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use caching where appropriate
   - Implement pagination for large result sets
   - Monitor API response times

2. **Frontend Performance**
   - Use code splitting
   - Implement lazy loading for components
   - Optimize bundle size
   - Use memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Migrations**
   - If you encounter migration errors, check the migration history
   - Run `alembic history` to see the current state
   - Use `alembic downgrade` to revert problematic migrations

2. **API Errors**
   - Check the API logs for detailed error messages
   - Verify request payload against the expected schema
   - Ensure authentication tokens are valid

3. **Frontend Build Issues**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
   - Check for TypeScript errors
   - Verify that all required environment variables are set

### Getting Help

1. **Documentation**
   - Check the project documentation first
   - Review relevant architectural decisions
   - Look for similar issues in the issue tracker

2. **Team Communication**
   - Ask questions in the team chat
   - Be specific about the problem you're facing
   - Share relevant code snippets or error messages

## Continuous Improvement

We encourage all team members to contribute to improving our development process:

1. **Process Improvements**
   - Suggest workflow improvements
   - Identify pain points in the current process
   - Share best practices from previous experiences

2. **Tool Recommendations**
   - Recommend tools that could improve productivity
   - Create proof-of-concepts for new approaches
   - Document the benefits of proposed changes

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Write technical blog posts about solved problems
   - Present interesting solutions in team meetings
   - Mentor new team members

# Project Refactoring and Reorganization

## Overview

The Pulse AI project has been refactored to create a more modular, maintainable, and developer-friendly structure. This document explains the changes made and how to adapt to the new structure.

## Changes Made

### New Directory Structure

```

### Package Structure

The source code is now organized as a proper Python package:

- `src/` is the root package directory
- Each subdirectory contains an `__init__.py` file
- The project can be installed with `pip install -e .`

### Import Path Changes

The import paths have been updated to reflect the new structure:

**Old imports:**
```python
from db.models import Employee
```

**New imports:**
```python
from src.db.models import Employee
```

## How to Adapt

### Running Scripts

Scripts should now be run as module imports from the project root:

**Old way:**
```bash
python generate_org_data.py
```

**New way:**
```bash
python -m src.scripts.generate_org_data
```

### Importing Modules

Update your imports to use the new package structure:

```python
# Database models
from src.db.models import Employee, Department

# Database operations
from src.db.import_data import DataImporter
```

### Development Environment

The development environment setup is still done with `setup_env.sh`, but now the package can be installed in development mode:

```bash
# Set up the virtual environment
./setup_env.sh

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

## Benefits of the New Structure

1. **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns with focused modules
2. **Maintainability**: Easier to navigate and understand the codebase
3. **Testability**: Dedicated test directory mirroring the source structure
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new components without cluttering the root directory
5. **Installability**: Project can be installed as a Python package
6. **Documentation**: Well-organized documentation with clear sections

## Next Steps

1. Run the reorganization script to apply all changes:
   ```bash
   ./reorganize_project.sh
   ```

2. Update import paths in your code:
   ```bash
   grep -r "from db" src/ --include="*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/from db/from src.db/g'
   ```

3. Test the new structure to ensure everything works as expected:
   ```bash
   python -m src.scripts.generate_org_data
   python -m src.db.import_data
   ```

4. Commit the reorganized project structure:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "refactor: reorganize project structure for modularity and maintainability"
   ```
